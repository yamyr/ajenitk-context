# Ongoing Tasks and Workflow Management

This document tracks active tasks, workflows, and iterative development cycles for the ajentik AI project. Updated continuously as work progresses.

## Ajentik Workflow Patterns (2025)

### Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Pattern
- [ ] Break down complex reasoning into explicit steps
- [ ] Document intermediate thoughts and decisions
- [ ] Verify logical consistency at each step
- [ ] Use structured thinking for problem decomposition
- [ ] Apply step-by-step verification

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Pattern
- [ ] Alternate between reasoning about the problem
- [ ] Take specific actions based on reasoning
- [ ] Observe results and adapt approach
- [ ] Maintain thought-action-observation cycles
- [ ] Document decision rationale

### Tree-of-Thought Pattern
- [ ] Generate multiple solution paths
- [ ] Evaluate each path independently
- [ ] Prune ineffective branches
- [ ] Select optimal reasoning tree
- [ ] Backtrack when necessary

### Self-Reflection Pattern
- [ ] Review outputs for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Identify potential improvements or errors
- [ ] Apply self-correction mechanisms
- [ ] Learn from mistakes and successes
- [ ] Update approach based on outcomes

### Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern
- [ ] Define agent roles and specializations
- [ ] Establish communication interfaces
- [ ] Implement consensus mechanisms
- [ ] Handle inter-agent conflicts
- [ ] Coordinate parallel execution

### Tool Use and Creation Pattern
- [ ] Assess tool requirements for tasks
- [ ] Verify tool compatibility and availability
- [ ] Create custom tools when gaps exist
- [ ] Monitor tool performance and reliability
- [ ] Maintain tool registry and documentation

### Memory and Context Management
- [ ] Implement hierarchical memory systems
- [ ] Manage context window efficiently
- [ ] Prioritize information retention
- [ ] Enable knowledge transfer between sessions
- [ ] Track temporal relationships in data
